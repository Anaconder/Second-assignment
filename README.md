Notes
bootstrap destroys all your hard earned css work because it has some of its preset settings that are loaded the moment you link it to your file.

Possible solutions?
putting your link to your stylesheet after the bootstrap link produces limited succes but some of your stuff still look weird.

I saw that I might need to get more specific in my styling.Ids for everyone?Or classes?¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Lastly, maybe come up with a naming system that's antibootstrap but it probably wont fully stop the bleeding.(¯―¯ ٥)
